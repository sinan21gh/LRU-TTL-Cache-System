LRU Eviction: Automatically removes the least recently used entries when the cache reaches its capacity.
TTL Expiration: Entries are removed after a specified time-to-live, keeping cache up-to-date.
Thread-Safe: Safe to use in multi-threaded environments.
Generic Support: Works with any key/value type.
JUnit Tests Included: Verify the cache’s behavior and experiment with different values and TTLs.
